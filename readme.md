# Face Identification

> computer vision is a powerful tool for identifying faces in an image.

In this repo I combine my two projects to create a face Identificaion system.

1. [Face detection](https://github.com/Vivek2509/Face_Detection)
2. [Face recognition](https://github.com/Vivek2509/Face_Recognition)


## Steps
1. You can download model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UXtRRJLpD5izx54-2K0jnN-Q9cgu_qaa?usp=sharing) <br>
2. Move `model.h5` file to [model](https://github.com/Vivek2509/Face_Identification/tree/main/Face_Identification/model) folder <br>
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
